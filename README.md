- 👋 Hi, I’m @hannahklair
- 👀 I’m interested in interdisciplinary social science that explores what we can do with quantitative methods while remaining skeptical!
- 🌱 Right now, I’m learning about the basics of Bayesian modelling, and DID modelling for natural/quasi-experiments.
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate on multilevel modelling projects--using either frequentist or Bayesian models--using STATA or R.
- 📫 How to reach me ...by email or on LinkedIn.
